                  <p class="list-group-item-text">I am taking this class because I want
                      to see if web development would be something I may like to make a career out of.
                  </p>
                  <p> I am mostly interested in the video game field and I think I would
                      enjoy it more but I am open to try as much in CIS as I can.

                      <p class="list-group-item-text">Outside of class I enjoy mostly PC gaming. 
                          I play a lot of different genres of games but recently I've only been playing a few games.
                      </p>
                      <p> The games I've been playing recently include GTA 5 w/ my roommates, Player Unkown's Battlegrounds,
                          World of Warcraft, and League of Legends.
                      </p>
                      <p> I am also pretty excited for Destiny 2 on PC and maybe Battlefront 2.
                      </p>
                      <p> Other than playing video games I work part-time at Academy Sports and Outdoors selling guns as well as being in the Army Reserves,
                          I also enjoy fishing when I get a chance to go with my father and hanging out with my girlfriend.
                      </p>
                      <p> The PC I play my games on I built myself for about $1,700 so it gets the job done and does it well.
